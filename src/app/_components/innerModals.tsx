      <h4>
        Opus was created as the main artefact for my dissertation.
        <br />
        <br />
        {
          "The original idea was to create an app that used AI to generate tasks based on the user's interests."
        }
        <br />
        <br />
        This concept evolved into the current Opus, a social media platform
        centred around creating tasks, and sharing hobbies and interests.
