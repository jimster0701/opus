      <h1>About Opus</h1>
      <br />
      <h4>
        The original idea for Opus was to create an app that used AI to generate
        tasks,
        {
          " based on the user's given interests, each day it would come up with 3 tasks that the user could complete."
        }
        <br />
        <br />
        That function is still a core part of Opus however after some research
        the idea became more focused on social aspects turning into a social
        media platform revolving around tasks and sharing your hobbies and
        interests.

        This was created as part of my university dissertation and will be live
        until the 23rd of May.
