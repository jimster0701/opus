      <h4>
        The orignal idea for this app came from a desire to reduce my own screen
        time and engage in more meaniful activities that I would enjoy off of my
        phone.
        <br />
        <br />
        The plan was to use AI to come up with tasks for the user based on their
        given interests.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each day it would generate 3 daily tasks that the user could complete in
        that day or at least take inspiration from.
        <br />
        <br />
        This function is still a core part of the app however to add more engage
        it felt right to focus more on social aspects of these tasks.
        <br />
        <br />
        This app was created as part of my university dissertation an thus will
        not be live for long.
        <br />
        <br />
        The official end date is the 23rd of May.
